Implementing Start Visit Button Ideas:

1) Connecting QCompleter.activated() to "store" the ID of the student in the start visit button
    Then when the button is pressed, creates a visit with the ID.

    So: 
        QCompleters "Loads" ID into button
        Button "Fires" it to make visit
    
    Issues:
        QCompleter.activated[QModelIndex] only returns the index within the CompleterModel, not the sourceModel
            Maybe create subclass of completer whose completerModel's index corresponds to the same item in sourceModel?

    Cons:
        ID would be contained in visit button. Prone to data synchonization issues.
            Potential solution may to find a way for the button to fetch ID directly from LineEdit? Or perhaps
            QCompleter stores its last completion somewhere.

NOTE TO SELF:
    See if github has framework to put these kinds of monologues somewhere

NOTE TO SELF:
    IF you change an ID in the histories table, the students table's "visiting" field does not update accordingly. Write new triggers for db

# Project Title

An attendance tracking program request by Kumon Springfield of Huntsman Square.

## Description

This application will enable the Kumon attendance tracking flow. Additionally, it will store the data and make it available via google drive.

- As a Kumon center owner, I would like to track the in-times and out-times of my students.
- As a Kumon front-desk worker, I would like to log students' attendance by simply having them scan the QR code on their folder when they come in and out.
- As a Kumon center owner, I would like to easily access records of my students' attendance from any device. Preferably from a platform I already use, such as Google Drive.
- As a Kumon center owner, I would like this application to work in the event that there is no internet.
- As a Kumon center owner, I would like data collected from this application to be reliable and reflect current records of student attendance.
- As a Kumon center owner, I want to ensure employees with access to the front-desk computer cannot tamper with student records.
